Below are some general rules & guidelines to keep in mind before and while contributing:
(only relevant for translators)

1. Is your submitted language already existing? Please check the `resources`-Directory before
2. Is the translated version safe from insults, hate, misleading content, ...?

## Translate AntiScam

1. Fork the repository
2. open `src/main/resources`
3. copy `messages_en_US.properties`
4. translate the values
5. Create a pull request and mention `Translation in [Language]` in it

We will merge it if the translations seem correct.
